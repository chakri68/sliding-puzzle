## Introduction

The 8-tile sliding puzzle is a classic puzzle consisting of an area divided into an 3x3 grid of squares, each of which is labeled with a number. The aim is to rearrange the tiles by sliding a tile into the empty space until the tiles are arranged in a particular order, usually from 1 to 8, and the empty space is at the bottom right.

This repository provides an implementation to solve the 8-tile sliding puzzle using two AI search algorithms: A* and BFS, written entirely in TypeScript.

## Features

- Solve 8-tile sliding puzzle using A* search algorithm.
- Solve 8-tile sliding puzzle using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed on your machine.
- TypeScript knowledge if you wish to modify or extend the codebase.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chakri68/sliding-puzzle.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sliding-puzzle
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Run the project using Webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```
